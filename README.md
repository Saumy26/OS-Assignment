# Multilevel Queue Scheduling Algorithm(MQSA).

A program for multilevel queue scheduling with different queues generated having a specific range of priority of each queue. Then, prompt the user to provide the number of processes and required details for each process such as arrival time, burst time and specific priority for each process. Then, apply Round Robin algorithm with quantum time 4 on queue with highest priority range. Apply priority scheduling algorithm on the queue with medium range of priority and First come first serve algorithm on the queue with lowest range of priority. Each and every queue should get a quantum time of 10 seconds. CPU will keep on shifting between queues after every 10 seconds.
